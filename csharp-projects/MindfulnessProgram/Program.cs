I completed the core requirements in this program, and I also added additional functionality
by making the loading animation using a Char array, and adding shorter delays to make the
animation smoother. I also made the animation so the amount of time it goes for is variable.
I also learned how to hide the cursor, and I implemented that strategy into parts of the program.
